    \item Advantages (+) of printed planar circuit technology:
        \begin{itemize}
            \itemsep0pt
            \item easy to fabricate (etching of arbitrary shapes)
            \item low profile
            \item integration
            \item conformal (curved) design
        \end{itemize}
    \item Function like \textit{EM cavity resonators} between printed trace and ground plate
    \item Fundamental resonance modes are TEM-modes
    \item Only \textit{tangential part of fringing fields} is radiated away
    \item Treatment by Huygens principle:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Enclose in a Huygens surface; substrate walls are PMC, conductors are PEC.
            \item Derive Huygens currents from cavity fields.
            \item Calculate radiation from Huygens sources.
        \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
