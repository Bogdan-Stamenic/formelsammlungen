\section{Antenna Range Evaluation}
\begin{definition}{Antenna Range Evaluation}
  (Far-field) Antenna range evaluation is the process of experimentally determining the state of the illuminating electromagnetic field over the quiet zone.
\end{definition}

Quiet zone metrics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Amplitude taper: Measured variation of second degree polynomial fit throught the magnitude data over the quiet zone, report in dB.
  \item Amplidtude ripple: Measured variation of magnitude data about second degree polynomial fit, measured in dB.
  \item Phase variation: Difference between maximum and minimum measured phase over the aperture of the quiet zone.
  \item Quiet zone reflectivity: Difference in dB between direct path and highest level of reflected energy entering the quiet zone.
\end{itemize}
