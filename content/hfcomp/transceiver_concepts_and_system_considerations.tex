\section{Transceiver Concepts and System Considerations}
\subsection{Transmitter Concepts}
\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0pt
    \item \textbf{Tuned Radio Transmitter:} the transmit signal is directly generated and processed. All components must support frequency tuning.
    \item \textbf{Superheterodyne Principle:} all signal process is done at a fixed intermediate frequency (IF). Other Frequencies are generated throught mixing.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Receiver Concepts}
\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0pt
    \item \textbf{Tunded Radio Receiver:} similar to tuned radio transmitter.
    \item \textbf{Superheterodyne Receiver:} HF-signal mixed down to a fixed IF for further processing. Multiple mixing stages and a \textit{lower IF} allowing for \textit{better amplification} and \textit{selectivity}.
    \item \textbf{Homodyne Receiver:} RF and LO couple phase coherently $\implies$ IF is 0. There are seperate I and Q receive channels.
\end{enumerate}
